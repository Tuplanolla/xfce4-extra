# Focuses the Xfce task list windows that
#  corrsepond to the given indices, in the order they appear.
# Requires that
#  at least one task list exists and that
#  it uses a certain ordering.
# The task list ordering Xfce uses is undocumented, but its source code reveals that
#  undecidable cases are resolved using decreasing window handle ordering [1] and that
#  windows with certain flags are skipped altogether [2].
# Errors due to wrong arguments are ignored by default to
#  prevent annoying error dialogs from popping up, but
#  they can be enabled by uncommenting the line that uses exit code 3.
